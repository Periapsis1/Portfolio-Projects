A project for the CS 340 "Intro to Database Design" class.
Worked on by Miguel Cruz and Michael Smith (A.K.A. "SQL Boys")

It models a database that a health clinic/hospital might use

It's a simple web server that accesses a database and allows the user to modify values.
It wasn't meant to be a client sided website. In other words, the users aren't patients but rather employees who are entering data for patients.

There are many features such as implementing Create and Read functionality for all tables, as well as Update and Delete functionality for some others.
